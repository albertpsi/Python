    "# Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces\n",

    "## Method Overriding\n",
    "Method overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class."
